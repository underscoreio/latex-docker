# Docker Image for Latex

This Docker image contains Latex and fonts etc that we use in our Latex documents. Use it for ... building Latex documents.


## Building

To build the image locally

```bash
docker build -t underscoreio/latex-docker:latest .
```

Push an update to Github and the [automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/underscoreio/latex-docker/builds/) will trigger.
See [Automated Builds on Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) for further details about this process.
